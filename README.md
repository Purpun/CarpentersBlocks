===================

This is the repository for all localization file for the mod Carpenter's Blocks.

Always use the en_US.lang file as the origin of your entries, this is the most up-to-date file!

Keep in mind these files HAVE to be .lang files and MUST be UTF-8 encoded, anything else will NOT work!
